# Landmarks iOS App

This project was created by following the SwiftUI Tutorial found [here](<https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui>). Landmarks is an app for discovering and sharing the places people love. This project is my first introduction to iOS and Swift programming and it is currently still a work in progress.
